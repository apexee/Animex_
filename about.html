<b>PLOT:</b>
In a post-apocalyptic world called Alcia, every human being had their worth measured by a special "Count" printed on their bodies, which records an important aspect of their life. This Count dictates their social standings in relation to others, with people bearing a lower Count being unable to refuse orders from someone with a higher Count. When this Count decreases to 0, the person will be dragged down into the "Abyss", and is said to be dead for all eternity. The system governing these aspects were called the Althing.

For young Hina Farrow, her Count (initially shown to be 441) corresponds to how many hundreds of kilometers she has walked. Ever since her mother was dragged into the Abyss and leaving her with a last wish, she has been traveling alone and searching for someone called the Legendary Ace for the last five years, all the while carrying an enigmatic sphere with a 10,000 Count on it, later revealed to be one of the seven original Ballots. Hina's journey took a sudden turn when she met a strange masked pervert, Licht Bach, with a negative -999 Count. Revealed to be a true Legendary Ace himself, Licht rescued Hina from an Ace impostor from the Alcian Royal Army, but claimed that he was not the Ace she was looking for.

Their journey led them to meeting with members from influential factions within Alcia. They also came into contact with a 300-years old long history and conspiracy linked to the Althing, the mystery surrounding the Legendary Aces, and the fate of the world itself.
